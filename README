Text::WagnerFischer is an implementation of the Wagner-Fischer edit distance in Perl.


PREREQUISITES

This suite requires Perl 5; I tested it only under Perl 5.6.

Text::WagnerFischer does not use any nonstandard modules.

You install Text::WagnerFischer by running these commands in the *nix environment:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test (optional)

To install Text::WagnerFischer in the Win32 environment, use nmake instead of make.
nmake is available for free (in a self extracting executable):

After download and inflate, put nmake.exe and nmake.err somewhere in your path.
